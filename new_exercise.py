# Given the list below
# sales = [120,450,800,50,900,300]
# Write a Python code that classifies items in the list as Low, Medium, or High. Also, do a count of items based on this classification and finally give a sum of items in each classification
# Key: less than 300 – low
#        > 300 <= 700 medium
# > 700 that's high

# From temperatures = [30,22,35,19,40], print those above average.
